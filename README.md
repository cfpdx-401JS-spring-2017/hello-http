# Lab 1: Keeley Hammond
## Complete!

### Hello HTTP: Day 1
 
In this lab, we had five main objectives:

* Send a GET request to root `/` or `index.html`, and return the contents of my HTML page.
* Send a GET request to `/fact`, and return a fun fact about the Sistine Chapel!
* Send a GET request to `/greeting` or `/greeting/<name>`, and be greeted by `hello stranger` or `hello ${name}`.
* Send a GET request to `/greeting/<name>/?salutation=<salutation>`, and be greeted by `<salutation> <name>`.
* Return a 404: `CANNOT <method> <url>` if anything else is placed into your GET request.

I passed all five tests.
